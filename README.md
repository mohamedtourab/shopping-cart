# shopping-cart
- for this project I didn't use any special framework. I just used normal java application. 
- You can find unit tests for the two main classes in the project (ShoppingCartCalculator,ShoppingCartRepository)
- There's a main method com.example.shoppingcart.ShoppingCartApplication.main that have a small code snippet to run the code and try it.
